I found myself re-writting the same basic JavaScript datastructures in various different projects, so I decided to store the barebones implementations here for the world.

Data Structures:

  *  The first data structure that we have is a time-expiring cache. 
  This lets you store some stuff that will automagically disappear after a while. 
  Look at expiring-collection.js for more information.
